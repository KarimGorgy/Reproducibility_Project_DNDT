# Implementation of DNDT (TensorFlow and PyTorch)

This GitHub repository presents our efforts to implement and extend the Deep Neural Decision Trees (DNDT) model, originally introduced by Yongxin Yang, Irene Garcia Morillo, and Timothy M. Hospedales. Our project aims to reproduce their innovative approach, which synergizes the interpretability of traditional decision trees with the representational power of deep neural networks. By providing open-source TensorFlow and PyTorch versions of DNDT, we not only validate the reproducibility of the original research but also explore enhancements and applications in various datasets.

## Origin

The DNDT model was first presented in the following paper:

"Deep Neural Decision Trees" by Yongxin Yang, Irene Garcia Morillo, Timothy M. Hospedales, ICML Workshop on Human Interpretability in Machine Learning (WHI 2018). The paper can be accessed [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06988.pdf).

## Project Context

Our work serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners alike, promoting further innovation and fostering a deeper understanding of the intricacies involved in building interpretable ML models. Through meticulous experimentation and benchmarking against standard datasets, we demonstrate the practicality of DNDT models in real-world scenarios. We encourage the academic community to engage with our repository, utilize our findings, and contribute to the ongoing dialogue around the importance of model interpretability.
